## Overview

Job Fit Assistant is a lightweight, AI-assisted tool that analyzes a job description against a CV to generate match insights, highlight skill gaps, and produce a tailored cover letter draft.

This project is intentionally scoped as a small MVP to focus on core problem-solving, prompt design, and end-to-end flow.  
While simple by design, it demonstrates how AI can be integrated thoughtfully into developer tools and can be extended into more advanced workflows.
